DESCRIPTION
    An aim of Plass is to present environment of instance-based-OOP.

Philosophy of Plass
  simplification of coding
    Plass aims destroy partition among class and object.

    Specifically, class-name contained in Plass-object is nonsense.

    Because Plass-object's class-name is "Plass".

    To generate an instance in instance-based-OOP means make clone from an
    universal instance.

  extendable easy
    In Plass, inherits is superseded by trait.

    Trait is expressed by Hash that contains some-values and/or coderef.

  usability over speed
    In developing Plass, please priority over usability than speed.
